# Hackathon Submission Analysis: Solsence

## Overview
This hackathon submission, titled **Solsence**, aims to simplify the process of searching Solana wallet history through natural language queries. The platform translates user queries into actionable blockchain data, making it accessible for users to analyze their crypto transactions. The codebase is built using **Next.js** and incorporates various features such as API routes, global styles, and a service for fetching asset details from the Helius API.

### Main Functionalities and Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: The core functionality revolves around translating user queries into blockchain data.
- **API Integration**: The codebase includes an API route to handle requests and fetch asset details from the Helius API.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a responsive and modern UI.
- **Global Styles**: Implements global CSS styles for consistent theming across the application.

## Criteria Analysis

### 1. Correctness
**Score: 8/10**

**Strengths**:
- The codebase runs without major errors, and the API route is functional, returning a valid response.

**Weaknesses**:
- The error handling in the `fetchAssetDetails` function could be improved. For instance, if the API key is not set, the function will still attempt to make a request, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Code Snippet**:
```javascript
const HELIUS_API_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_API_KEY;

export const fetchAssetDetails = async (mint: string) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=${HELIUS_API_KEY}`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                jsonrpc: "2.0",
                id: "text",
                method: "getAsset",
                params: {
                    id: mint,
                }
            }),
        });
        // Error handling could be improved here
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching asset details:", error);
        return null;
    }
};
```
**Improvements**:
- Implement a check to ensure `HELIUS_API_KEY` is defined before making the API call. This will prevent unnecessary requests and improve the robustness of the code.

### 2. Readability
**Score: 7/10**

**Strengths**:
- The code is generally well-structured, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., API routes, services, and styles).
- The use of TypeScript enhances type safety and clarity.

**Weaknesses**:
- Some functions could benefit from additional comments explaining their purpose and logic, especially for complex operations.

**Code Snippet**:
```javascript
export default function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse<Data>,
) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: "John Doe" });
}
```
**Improvements**:
- Adding comments to explain the purpose of the API handler and the expected request/response structure would enhance readability.

### 3. Bugginess
**Score: 6/10**

**Strengths**:
- The codebase does not exhibit any critical bugs that prevent it from running.

**Weaknesses**:
- There are potential edge cases that are not handled, such as network errors or invalid responses from the API.

**Code Snippet**:
```javascript
if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch asset details");
}
```
**Improvements**:
- Implement more comprehensive error handling to manage different types of errors (e.g., network issues, invalid input) and provide user feedback.

### 4. Features
**Score: 7/10**

**Strengths**:
- The submission includes essential features for querying blockchain data and a basic API setup.

**Weaknesses**:
- The functionality for translating natural language queries into blockchain data is not implemented in the provided codebase, which is a critical feature for the project.

**Improvements**:
- Focus on implementing the natural language processing feature to fulfill the core promise of the application. This could involve integrating a library or service that can parse and interpret user queries.

## Final Score
**Final Score: 7/10**

### Summary
The **Solsence** submission demonstrates a solid foundation with functional API integration and a responsive design. However, it lacks some critical features and could benefit from improved error handling and documentation. With focused improvements, particularly in implementing the core functionality and enhancing robustness, this project has the potential to be a valuable tool for users looking to analyze their Solana wallet history.
