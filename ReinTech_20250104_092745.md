# Hackathon Submission Analysis: ReinTech

## Overview
This hackathon submission, titled **ReinTech**, aims to address the last mile problem in algorithmic trading by allowing users to develop, backtest, and execute perpetual trading strategies on the Drift exchange. The codebase consists of several modules that handle various functionalities, including backtesting strategies, placing orders, and fetching historical data.

### Main Functionalities and Features
1. **Backtesting Engine**: The `backtesting_engine.py` file contains functions to calculate performance metrics such as cumulative return, annualized return, Sharpe ratio, and win rate.
2. **Trading Strategies**: The code includes examples of trading strategies, such as moving average crossovers and RSI trend-following strategies.
3. **Order Placement**: The `drift_place_order.py` file provides functionality to place orders on the Drift exchange.
4. **Data Fetching**: The `drift_tools.py` file allows users to download historical candle data for various trading pairs.
5. **User Interaction**: The `trading_agent.py` file integrates various tools and models to facilitate user interaction and trading strategy implementation.

## Criteria Analysis

### 1. Correctness
**Score: 7/10**

**Strengths**:
- The core functionalities, such as backtesting and order placement, appear to be implemented correctly based on the provided code snippets.

**Weaknesses**:
- There are commented-out sections in the code, such as the `rsi_trend_following_strategy` function, which may indicate incomplete features or testing.
- The `backtest_strategy` function does not handle potential exceptions that may arise from file reading or data processing.

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- Ensure all functions are fully implemented and tested before submission.
- Add error handling in critical functions to prevent crashes during execution.

### 2. Readability
**Score: 6/10**

**Strengths**:
- The code is generally well-structured, with clear function definitions and comments explaining the purpose of each function.

**Weaknesses**:
- Some functions, such as `backtest_strategy`, could benefit from more detailed docstrings explaining parameters and return values.
- The use of magic numbers (e.g., `252` for trading days) without explanation can confuse readers.

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- Enhance docstrings for all functions to provide comprehensive descriptions of parameters and return types.
- Replace magic numbers with named constants to improve clarity.

### 3. Bugginess
**Score: 5/10**

**Strengths**:
- The code compiles and runs without major syntax errors, indicating a reasonable level of bugginess.

**Weaknesses**:
- The commented-out code suggests that some features may not be fully functional or tested.
- The `place_order` function does not handle cases where the order placement might fail, which could lead to unhandled exceptions.

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- Conduct thorough testing of all features to identify and fix any hidden bugs.
- Implement robust error handling in functions that interact with external APIs or perform critical operations.

### 4. Features
**Score: 8/10**

**Strengths**:
- The submission includes a variety of features, such as backtesting, order placement, and strategy implementation, which are essential for a trading application.

**Weaknesses**:
- Some features, like the RSI strategy, are commented out, indicating they may not be fully functional or tested.

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- Ensure all planned features are fully implemented and operational.
- Consider adding more trading strategies or enhancing existing ones to provide users with more options.

## Final Score
**Final Score: 6.5/10**

### Summary
The **ReinTech** submission demonstrates a solid foundation for a trading application, with key functionalities implemented effectively. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of code completeness, readability, and error handling. By addressing these weaknesses, the submission could significantly enhance its robustness and user experience.
