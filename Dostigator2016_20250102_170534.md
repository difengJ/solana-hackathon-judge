# Hackathon Submission Analysis: Dostigator2016

## Overview
This hackathon submission, titled **Dostigator2016**, is a web application designed to assist users in achieving their goals through task decomposition and progress tracking. The application leverages artificial intelligence and web3 technology to enhance user experience and functionality. The main features include user registration and authentication, goal creation, task management, and integration with an external API for task suggestions.

### Main Functionalities and Features
- **User Management**: Registration and login functionality using hashed passwords for security.
- **Goal Management**: Users can create and manage their goals, which are stored in a SQLite database.
- **Task Suggestions**: Integration with an external API to suggest tasks based on user-defined goals.
- **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the application seamlessly.

## Criteria Analysis

### 1. Correctness
**Score: 7/10**

**Strengths**:
- The application runs without major errors, and the basic functionalities such as user registration, login, and goal creation work as intended.

**Weaknesses**:
- There are some redundant database creation scripts in both `database.js` and `create.js`, which could lead to confusion. For example:
  ```javascript
  // database.js
  db.serialize(() => {
    db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (...)`);
    db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS goals (...)`);
  });
  
  // create.js
  db.serialize(() => {
    db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (...)`);
    db.run(`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS goals (...)`);
  });
  ```
  This redundancy can lead to potential issues if the database schema needs to be updated, as changes would need to be made in multiple places.

**Improvements**:
- Consolidate the database initialization logic into a single file to avoid redundancy and potential errors in future updates.

### 2. Readability
**Score: 6/10**

**Strengths**:
- The code is generally well-structured, with clear separation of concerns (e.g., routes, database logic, and front-end files).

**Weaknesses**:
- Some variable names and comments are in Russian, which may hinder understanding for non-Russian speakers. For example:
  ```javascript
  // routes/goals.js
  router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    if (!req.session.user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Необходима авторизация.' }); // "Authorization required."
    }
  });
  ```
  This can make it difficult for a broader audience to understand the code.

**Improvements**:
- Use English for all variable names and comments to enhance readability for a global audience. Additionally, consider adding more descriptive comments explaining the purpose of complex logic.

### 3. Bugginess
**Score: 5/10**

**Strengths**:
- The application handles errors in user authentication and goal management reasonably well, providing appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

**Weaknesses**:
- There are potential issues with the API key being hardcoded in `test.js` and `assisterr-integration.js`, which poses a security risk:
  ```javascript
  const API_KEY = 'M75Kr69Ec-bqkIgA2-DhsZsVq8t-tMSzdCpDodVTKEM'; // Hardcoded API key
  ```
  This could lead to unauthorized access if the code is shared publicly.

**Improvements**:
- Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the source code. This can be achieved using a package like `dotenv`.

### 4. Features
**Score: 8/10**

**Strengths**:
- The application includes essential features such as user authentication, goal management, and task suggestions, which align well with the hackathon's objectives.

**Weaknesses**:
- While the core features are present, there is a lack of advanced functionalities such as user feedback mechanisms or progress tracking over time.

**Improvements**:
- Consider adding features like user progress tracking, notifications for goal deadlines, or a dashboard to visualize goal completion rates. This would enhance user engagement and provide more value.

## Final Score
**Final Score: 6.5/10**

### Summary
Dostigator2016 is a promising submission with a solid foundation for a goal management application. While it demonstrates good functionality and correctness, there are areas for improvement in readability, bugginess, and feature richness. By addressing the identified weaknesses, the codebase can be significantly enhanced to provide a better user experience and maintainability.
