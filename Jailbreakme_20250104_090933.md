Project Name: Jailbreakme


Project Description: The first open-source decentralized app where organizations test their AI models and agents while users earn rewards for jailbreaking them. We host tournaments for AI agents where user have to face off an AI to win and either convince it or jailbreak it using novel techniques.

# Hackathon Submission Analysis: Jailbreakme

## Overview

This hackathon submission, titled **Jailbreakme**, is an open-source decentralized application (dApp) designed for organizations to test their AI models and agents while allowing users to earn rewards for jailbreaking them. The application hosts tournaments where users face off against AI agents, attempting to convince or jailbreak them using innovative techniques.

### Main Functionalities and Features
- **Tournament Management**: Users can create and participate in tournaments, with various parameters such as entry fees, prize distribution, and rules.
- **AI Interaction**: Users interact with AI agents, attempting to bypass restrictions and reveal secrets.
- **Reward System**: Successful users are rewarded from a prize pool based on their performance in the tournament.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Utilizes blockchain technology for transaction management and verification.
- **User Authentication**: Implements JWT and Solana wallet authentication for secure user access.

## Criteria Analysis

### 1. Correctness
**Score: 7/10**

**Strengths**:
- The codebase appears to be well-structured, with clear separation of concerns across different modules (e.g., routes, services, validators).
- The use of Joi for validation ensures that input data adheres to expected formats, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors.

**Weaknesses**:
- There are instances where error handling could be improved. For example, in the `backend/routes/auth.js` file, the error handling in the `verifyToken` function could be more descriptive:
  ```javascript
  if (!authHeader?.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: "No token provided" });
  }
  ```
  This could be enhanced to provide more context about the failure.

**Improvements**:
- Implement more comprehensive error handling throughout the application to provide clearer feedback to users and developers.
- Consider adding unit tests to ensure that critical functionalities work as expected.

### 2. Readability
**Score: 6/10**

**Strengths**:
- The code is generally organized, with meaningful variable and function names that convey their purpose.
- The use of comments in some areas helps clarify the intent of complex logic.

**Weaknesses**:
- Some files, such as `backend/routes/program.js`, contain long functions that could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces. For example:
  ```javascript
  router.post("/quick-start-tournament", upload.single("pfp"), solanaAuth, async
