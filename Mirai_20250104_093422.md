# Hackathon Submission Analysis: Mirai

## Overview
This hackathon submission, titled "Mirai," is designed to serve as an AI trading advisor that utilizes various crypto trading strategies. The main functionality allows users to instruct Mirai to trade their portfolio based on specified strategies. The project also includes a plugin for on-chain capabilities on Solana, leveraging Crossmint custodial wallets. 

### Main Functionalities and Features
- **AI Trading Advisor**: Users can interact with Mirai to execute trading strategies.
- **Custom Character Support**: Users can modify or create custom characters for the trading agent.
- **Multi-Client Support**: The ability to add clients such as Twitter and Discord for interaction.
- **Environment Configuration**: Users can set up their environment variables for API keys and credentials.

## Criteria Analysis

### 1. Correctness
**Score: 7/10**

**Strengths**: 
- The codebase appears to have a clear structure, and the README provides instructions for setup and usage, which indicates a level of correctness in terms of usability.

**Weaknesses**: 
- There is a lack of error handling in the code snippets provided. For instance, if the user inputs an incorrect path for the character file, the application may crash without a clear error message. 

**Improvement Suggestions**: 
- Implement try-catch blocks around critical operations, especially file handling and API calls, to ensure that the application can gracefully handle errors and provide feedback to the user.

### 2. Readability
**Score: 6/10**

**Strengths**: 
- The README file is well-organized and provides clear instructions for users, which enhances the overall readability of the project.

**Weaknesses**: 
- The code itself lacks comments and documentation. For example, the character modification section in `agent/src/character.ts` does not explain the purpose of the character object or its properties.

```typescript
// Example of a character object without comments
const character = {
  name: "Mirai",
  strategies: ["strategy1", "strategy2"],
};
```

**Improvement Suggestions**: 
- Add comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of functions, classes, and complex logic. This will help future developers (or even the original authors) understand the code more easily.

### 3. Bugginess
**Score: 5/10**

**Strengths**: 
- The project seems to run without major issues based on the provided instructions, indicating a reasonable level of stability.

**Weaknesses**: 
- The presence of hardcoded values in the `.env` example can lead to potential security issues and bugs if users forget to replace them. For example:

```bash
-DISCORD_API_TOKEN= # Bot token
+DISCORD_API_TOKEN="OTk1MTU1NzcyMzYxMT000000.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```

**Improvement Suggestions**: 
- Remove hardcoded values from the example and provide a clearer template. Additionally, implement validation checks for environment variables to ensure they are set correctly before the application runs.

### 4. Features
**Score: 8/10**

**Strengths**: 
- The submission includes a variety of features such as custom character support, multi-client integration, and on-chain capabilities, which are relevant to the hackathon's theme.

**Weaknesses**: 
- While the features are present, there is limited documentation on how to effectively use them, particularly the custom character functionality.

**Improvement Suggestions**: 
- Expand the documentation to include examples of how to create and use custom characters, as well as detailed explanations of the trading strategies available. This will enhance user experience and feature utilization.

## Final Score
**Final Score: 6.5/10**

### Summary
The "Mirai" submission demonstrates a solid foundation for an AI trading advisor with several useful features. However, improvements in error handling, code readability, and documentation are necessary to enhance the overall quality of the codebase. By addressing these areas, the submission could significantly improve its correctness, readability, and robustness, ultimately leading to a better user experience.
