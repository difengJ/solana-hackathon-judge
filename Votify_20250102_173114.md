# Hackathon Submission Analysis: Votify

## Overview
This hackathon submission, named **Votify**, aims to simplify the DAO governance voting process using AI. The main functionality of Votify is to provide insights and summaries of DAO proposals, making it easier for users to understand lengthy texts and discussions. The project leverages Puppeteer for web scraping, Next.js for the frontend, and integrates with Google Generative AI for summarization.

### Main Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extracts data from DAO proposals using Puppeteer.
- **AI Summarization**: Utilizes Google Generative AI to summarize the content of proposals.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Implements a voting system for DAO proposals.
- **User Registration**: Allows users to register and participate in voting.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for API requests and scraping.

## Criteria Analysis

### 1. Correctness
**Score: 7/10**

**Strengths**:
- The codebase appears to run without major errors, and the main functionalities are implemented correctly.
- The use of `try-catch` blocks in asynchronous functions helps manage errors effectively.

**Weaknesses**:
- There are some commented-out sections in the code, such as in `src/requestsHandler/programConnector/index.ts`, which may indicate incomplete features or debugging remnants:
  ```javascript
  // export const registerVoter = async (index: number, program: Program, user: string) => {
  //     ...
  // }
  ```
  This can lead to confusion about the current state of the code and whether certain features are functional.

**Improvements**:
- Remove or complete commented-out code to enhance clarity.
- Implement more comprehensive testing to ensure all features work as intended.

### 2. Readability
**Score: 6/10**

**Strengths**:
- The code is generally well-structured, with clear separation of concerns across different files.
- The use of TypeScript interfaces enhances type safety and provides clarity on data structures.

**Weaknesses**:
- Some variable names are not descriptive enough, which can hinder understanding. For example, `data` in the `post` method of `src/requestsHandler/request.ts` could be more descriptive:
  ```javascript
  post: async ({ url, data }) => {
  ```
  A more descriptive name like `requestData` would improve clarity.

**Improvements**:
- Use more descriptive variable and function names to enhance understanding.
- Add comments to complex logic sections to explain the purpose and functionality.

### 3. Bugginess
**Score: 5/10**

**Strengths**:
- Basic error handling is implemented, which helps manage potential issues during API calls and scraping.

**Weaknesses**:
- The error handling could be more robust. For instance, in `src/app/api/scrape/route.ts`, the error message returned is generic:
  ```javascript
  return Response.json({ message: "Failed to Scrap Content" }, { status: 400, })
  ```
  This does not provide enough context for debugging.

**Improvements**:
- Enhance error messages to include more context about the failure.
- Implement unit tests to catch bugs early in the development process.

### 4. Features
**Score: 8/10**

**Strengths**:
- The submission includes a solid set of features that align with the hackathon's goals, such as web scraping, AI summarization, and a voting mechanism.
- The integration with Google Generative AI is a strong feature that adds value to the project.

**Weaknesses**:
- Some features, like user registration and fetching personal proposals, are mentioned but not fully implemented or tested in the provided code.

**Improvements**:
- Complete the implementation of all planned features and ensure they are thoroughly tested.
- Consider adding user feedback mechanisms to improve the user experience.

## Final Score
**Final Score: 6.5/10**

### Summary
The Votify submission demonstrates a solid foundation with its core functionalities and features. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of code readability, error handling, and completeness of features. By addressing these weaknesses, the submission could significantly enhance its overall quality and user experience.
